Brief Overview
The Wise Ecosystem is a decentralized financial platform that aims to create a sustainable financial ecosystem in the crypto space. It is built around the `$WISE` token, which is backed by a pool of ETH and appreciates based on the revenue earned from the platform's dApps. Unlike most other tokens, `$WISE` is not used to pay out APY rewards to dApp users, but instead is used to create deflation. The platform's flagship dApp is WiseLending, a no-strings-attached lending and borrowing protocol that allows users to earn passively by depositing crypto into lending pools and access competitive yield-farming strategies. The Wise DAO, which drives value to the community rather than VCs, is also a key component of the ecosystem. The platform is currently live and has been working as intended since December 2020. Projects can benefit from the Wise Ecosystem by pairing their token with `$WISE` for liquidity, which allows them to piggyback on the value created by the ecosystem. Grants and developer support are available for those who wish to join the ecosystem.

My analysis focuses on the additional risk that comes from the composability within the in-scope systems.
The goal of the analysis is to show my adversarial thought process and to suggest a robust security process to ship the codebase in a state that is maintainable and safer for people to use. Please note that untill explicitly stated otherwise, any architectural risks or implementation issues mentioned in this analysis are not to be considered vulnerabilities for altering the architecture or code solely based on this analysis. As an auditor, I acknowledge the vitality of a thorough evaluation for design decisions in a complex project, taking associated risks into consideration as one single part of an overarching process. 

Codebase Approach 
Understanding the Contract -  Thoroghly examining `audit documentation and scope`, understanding the purpose, functionality, and architecture of the contract. This includes reviewing the codebase, documentation, and any related materials.

Static Analysis - Performed  thorough static analysis of the contract's source code. This involves reviewing the code for potential vulnerabilities, such as input validation issues, access control problems, reentrancy vulnerabilities, overflow and underflow issues, gas limit attack susceptibilities, timestamp dependency risks, front running attack vulnerabilities, and denial of service (DoS) attack susceptibilities.

Dynamic Analysis - I also performed dynamic analysis of the protocol by executing the contract in a controlled environment, such as a local development node and a testing framework. This helped identify any runtime issues, such as unexpected behavior, crashes, or other anomalies.

Substrate Testing - Setup and Tests - Setting up to execute forge test was remarkably effortless, greatly enhancing the efficiency of the auditing process. With a fully functional test harness at our disposal, we not only accelerate the testing of intricate concepts and potential vulnerabilities but also gain insights into the developerâ€™s expectations regarding the implementation. Moreover, we can deliver
more value to the project by incorporating our proofs of concept into its tests wherever feasible.

Manual Code Review - I then manually reviewed  the contract's source code, focusing on critical areas of the codebase, such as functions that handle user input, functions that manage access control, and functions that perform sensitive operations.

Reverse Engineering - In some cases, I may needed to perform reverse engineering on the contract's compiled binary code to gain a deeper understanding of the contract's inner workings and to identify any hidden vulnerabilities or backdoors.

Exploit Development - Moving on, as I identified any potential vulnerabilities in the contract, I would attempt to develop proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits to demonstrate the feasibility of exploiting the identified vulnerabilities bearing in mind, invariants and critial parts of functions that can lead to users lossing funds.

Reporting and Remediation - Finally, I prepared a detailed report outlining the identified vulnerabilities, the associated risks, and recommendations for remediation. I also provide guidance on how to fix the identified vulnerabilities and how to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.

Architecture
The architecture of the WiseLending contract, incorporates several key components and patterns that suggests a comprehensive approach to building a DeFi lending platform that aims to leverage the benefits of decentralized finance while addressing its inherent challenges.
The `constructor` function initializes the contract with addresses for the master, Wise Lending, and Aave Hub. This setup is crucial for the contract's operation, as it defines the roles and addresses involved in the contract's logic.
The `getLiveDebtRatio` function calculates the debt ratio of a position in normal mode, which is a critical metric for understanding the financial health of a position. It uses a precision factor to ensure the ratio is represented accurately.
The `setLiquidationSettings` function allows the master to configure liquidation settings, including base rewards and maximum fees. This is important for managing the liquidation process and ensuring it aligns with the contract's risk management strategy.
The `prepareCurvePools` and curveSecurityCheck functions are related to interacting with Curve pools, a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator. These functions ensure that the contract can safely interact with Curve pools, including approving tokens for swapping and performing security checks.
The `checksLiquidation`, `checksWithdraw`, `checksSolelyWithdraw`, `checksBorrow`, `checksCollateralizeDeposit`, `checkUncollateralizedDeposit`, `checkHealthState`, `checkBadDebtLiquidation`, `overallLendingAPY`, `overallBorrowAPY`, `overallNetAPY`, and `safeLimitPosition` functions are various checks and calculations related to the financial operations of the contract, such as liquidation, withdrawal, borrowing, and deposit operations. These functions are crucial for ensuring the contract's logic operates correctly and securely.

Strengths
Modularity and Reusability - The contract is structured to be modular, with clear separation of concerns. For example, the use of modifiers like `healthStateCheck` and `syncPool` for specific operations enhances code readability and reusability.
Security Checks - The contract includes comprehensive security checks, such as `_checkHealthState`, `_compareSharePrices`, and `_getCurrentSharePriceMax`. These checks ensure that operations are only executed under safe conditions, reducing the risk of exploits.
Automated Scaling Algorithm (LASA) - The LASA algorithm is designed to dynamically adjust pool data based on token prices, which can help maintain liquidity and efficiency in the lending pool.
Event Emitting - The contract emits events for significant actions like deposits and withdrawals. This is crucial for transparency and tracking of contract activities.
Reentrancy Guard - The use of `_checkReentrancy` in `_syncPoolBeforeCodeExecution` suggests an attempt to mitigate reentrancy attacks, which is a common vulnerability in smart contracts.

Downsides
Complexity - The contract is quite complex, with multiple modifiers, internal functions, and external functions. This complexity can increase the risk of bugs and make the contract harder to audit and maintain.
Gas Costs - The use of modifiers and the LASA algorithm, which likely involves complex calculations, could lead to higher gas costs for transactions. This might discourage users from interacting with the contract.
Dependency on External Contracts: The contract relies heavily on external contracts (e.g., WISE_SECURITY, WISE_ORACLE, ICurve). This introduces a dependency risk. If any of these external contracts are compromised or behave unexpectedly, it could affect the entire system.
Lack of Detailed Documentation - While the contract includes comments explaining the purpose of functions and modifiers, more detailed documentation on the overall architecture, security considerations, and potential edge cases would be beneficial for developers and auditors.
Potential for Reentrancy Attacks - While the contract includes a reentrancy guard, it's crucial to ensure that all external calls are made after state changes. Failure to do so could still expose the contract to reentrancy attacks.

 Mechanism Review
My Mechanism review for the WiseLending contract, focuses on governance, transparency, dispute resolution, and future considerations.

Governance Mechanism
On-Chain Governance - The WiseLending contract, being a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol, likely employs on-chain governance where rules and decision-making processes are embedded in the smart contract code itself. This ensures that the rules are enforced by the blockchain network, and any changes to the rules need to be approved by the network participants.
Off-Chain Governance - While not explicitly mentioned, off-chain governance could also be a part of the WiseLending protocol's governance model, involving stakeholders outside the blockchain network for decision-making processes. This model allows for more complex decision-making processes but can be more prone to centralization.

Transparency and Auditability
Transparency and Auditability - The contract should ensure transparency and auditability, making all transactions visible to all parties and having mechanisms in place to detect and prevent fraud. This is crucial for building trust among users and stakeholders.

Dispute Resolution Mechanism
Dispute Resolution - The WiseLending contract should include mechanisms for resolving disputes that may arise during the contract's execution. This could involve the use of arbitration or other dispute resolution mechanisms that are agreed upon by all parties involved in the contract.
Upgradability
Upgradability - The contract should be designed to allow for upgrades and changes to the system, ensuring that the contract remains relevant and can adapt to changing market conditions. However, any changes to the contract should be agreed upon by all parties, and there should be mechanisms in place to prevent unauthorized changes.

Future Considerations
Standards and DAOs - As the use of smart contracts continues to grow, there will be an increased focus on developing industry-wide standards for smart contract governance. The emergence of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) could revolutionize traditional governance models by removing the need for central authorities and intermediaries.
Oracles - The role of oracles in providing data to smart contracts and triggering events based on external data sources will become increasingly important. However, there is a risk that oracles could be compromised or manipulated, which could undermine the integrity of the entire smart contract system.

Systemic Risks
Smart Contract Vulnerabilities - Vulnerabilities in smart contracts can lead to exploits that could disrupt the entire DeFi ecosystem. This includes vulnerabilities in the WiseLending contract itself or in any external contracts it interacts with.
Over-Collateralization - Over-collateralization, where users lock up more assets than necessary to secure a loan, can lead to liquidity issues if the value of the collateral falls significantly. This risk is particularly relevant in the context of lending and borrowing protocols like WiseLending 5.
Concentration of Assets - The concentration of assets within a few DeFi protocols increases systemic risk. If a large portion of the DeFi ecosystem's assets are concentrated in a few protocols, a failure in one of these protocols could have a significant impact on the entire ecosystem.

Mitigation
Smart Contract Audits and Security - Conduct thorough audits of smart contracts by reputable security firms to identify vulnerabilities and bugs in the code. Continuous monitoring of smart contracts is also crucial to promptly address any identified vulnerabilities.
Diversification and Asset Collateralization - Encourage diversification of assets among users and avoid over-collateralization in protocols. Protocols that accept multiple types of collateral and implement dynamic collateralization ratios based on market conditions can enhance stability and resilience.
Stress Testing and Scenario Simulations - Perform stress testing and simulated extreme scenarios to identify weaknesses in DeFi protocols. This helps improve risk management and assess the overall health of the ecosystem.
Decentralization and User Education - Promote decentralization and educate users about DeFi risks. This is essential for reducing centralization risks and enhancing the overall stability of the DeFi ecosystem.
Insurance and Stability Mechanisms - Implement insurance mechanisms and stability protocols to protect users and the ecosystem from large-scale losses. This includes mechanisms for liquidation, short-selling, and other forms of risk management.
By addressing these systemic risks through the suggested mitigation strategies, the WiseLending contract and the broader DeFi ecosystem can fortify themselves against potential crises, establishing a solid foundation for sustained growth and resilience in the face of unforeseen challenges.
