## 1 . Introductionüåü

 

Wise Lending is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that harnesses the power of cryptocurrency to create a new lending experience. It functions as a liquidity marketplace, connecting borrowers and lenders directly.


This report provides a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the Wise Lending smart contract codebase. As a complex decentralized system, Wise Lending aims to enable secure and efficient decentralized lending, contributing to the rapidly growing DeFi (Decentralized Finance) landscape.




**Wise Lending positions itself as a decentralized liquidity marketplace for crypto assets. Users can participate in two primary ways:**

- **Suppliers**: Deposit crypto holdings and earn interest through a variable Annual Percentage Yield (APY).
- **Borrowers**: Access loans in various cryptocurrencies by leveraging their deposited assets as collateral.

This review covers various aspects of the codebase, including its architecture, design, and implementation details. By examining the contract structure, logic, and interactions, this report identifies potential areas of improvement and offers suggestions to enhance the codebase. The recommendations provided are based on best practices in Solidity development, gas optimization techniques, and security considerations, ensuring a more robust, secure, and efficient system.

### 1.1 Core Functionalities
- **Smart Contract-powered Lending**: Wise Lending relies on smart contracts to automate loan origination, interest calculations, and collateralization. This fosters trust and transparency while minimizing the need for intermediaries.
- **Variable APY**: The interest rate earned by suppliers fluctuates based on supply and demand for specific crypto assets. Higher demand for a particular asset translates to a potentially higher APY for suppliers.
- **Collateralized Loans**: Borrowers deposit crypto assets as collateral to secure loans. The loan-to-value (LTV) ratio determines the maximum loan amount a borrower can access.
- **Liquidity Pools**: Funds are pooled together, creating a more efficient system for matching borrowers and lenders.

### 1.2 Potential Benefits
- **Higher Returns for Suppliers**: Compared to traditional savings accounts, Wise Lending offers the potential for significantly higher returns on deposited crypto assets.
- **Improved Access to Capital**: Borrowers can access crypto loans without traditional credit checks, offering greater flexibility for individuals with limited credit history.
- **Transparency and Immutability**: The use of blockchain technology ensures transparency in transactions and immutability of data, fostering trust within the platform.
- **Frictionless Borrowing and Lending**: Smart contracts automate processes, streamlining loan origination and repayment.

### 1.3 Whats Unique??


Here's what makes Wise Lending unique compared to other crypto lending platforms

- **Built from Scratch:** Unlike many platforms that copy existing code, Wise Lending is built from the ground up, allowing for more innovative features .
- **Power Farms:** This offers advanced users unique ways to earn interest on their crypto holdings .
- **Focus on Capital Efficiency:** Wise Lending prioritizes maximizing returns for lenders .
- **Isolation Mode:** Borrowers can access up to 95% loan-to-value ratio on specific assets without impacting other holdings.
- **Lending Automated Scaling Algorithm (LASA AI):** This feature helps automatically adjust interest rates to maintain a healthy lending pool .
- **NFT collateralization:** Loan positions are represented as NFTs, potentially offering increased flexibility .
- **Payback with Lending Shares:** Borrowers can potentially repay loans using Wise Lending's governance token for additional benefits .
- **Capped Liquidation Fees:** This reduces the risk of sudden and excessive losses for borrowers during market downturns .
- **Solely Deposit Mode:** Currently, Wise Lending only allows users to deposit crypto assets, focusing on optimizing returns for lenders .

### 3.2 key mechanic & Approaches 

**Interfaces and Inheritance**: Many contracts inherit from interfaces, which define function prototypes, ensuring that specific methods are implemented. This promotes modularity and reusability.

**Access Control**: Many contracts use Ownable or OwnableMaster for controlling ownership and access to specific functions, preventing unauthorized changes to the contract state.

**Lending and Borrowing**: The core lending and borrowing functionalities are managed through WiseLendingDeclaration, WiseOracleHub, and AaveHub. These contracts interact with Aave protocol to provide lending and borrowing services.

**Fee Management**: FeeManager and DeclarationsFeeManager are responsible for managing and distributing fees collected throughout the platform. FeeManagerHelper provides additional helper functions for the fee management process.

**Security**: WiseSecurity and WiseSecurityDeclarations manage user security. Users can secure their positions by depositing collateral in these contracts.

**Power Farming**: The platform facilitates power farming through various contracts: PendlePowerFarmController, PendlePowerFarmDeclarations, PendlePowerFarmLeverageLogic, PendlePowerFarmMathLogic, PendlePowerFarmControllerHelper, and PendlePowerFarmTokenFactory. These contracts aim to provide leverage farming opportunities for users.

**Oracle Functionality**: Various oracle contracts, such as OracleHelper, PendleLpOracle, PendleChildLpOracle, PtOraclePure, and PtOracleDerivative provide pricing data for assets used in the platform, ensuring accurate calculations for lending, borrowing, and farming operations.

**Low-Level Helper Functions**: Contracts such as WiseLowLevelHelper and WiseCore provide low-level helper functions used throughout the platform.

**Transfer and Approval Helpers**: Various helper contracts, such as SendValueHelper, WrapperHelper, CallOptionalReturn, TransferHelper, ApprovalHelper, help manage token approvals and transfers.

**Events**: Event tracking is used for monitoring and tracking relevant activities on the platform with contracts like FeeManagerEvents, AaveEvents, and AaveHub.

## 6 . Approach Taken Reviewing the Codebase üìù



While reviewing Wise Lending codebase , I take a methodical and thorough approach to ensure that the code is secure, efficient, and adheres to best practices. Here is an overview of the approaches I take

-  Before diving into the code, I familiarize myself with the system architecture, high-level design, and the interactions between different contracts. This helps me understand the overall flow of the application, which is crucial for identifying potential issues and attack vectors.
- I perform a deep code review, examining each line of code and its corresponding tests . I pay close attention to security-critical functions and areas such as user input handling, token transfers, access control, and cryptographic operations. Key aspects I look for include

    -Proper handling of user input validation
    - Use of secure patterns for token transfers and interaction with external contracts
    - Correct implementation of access control and role management
    - Appropriate handling of error scenarios and exceptions
    - Proper use of encryption and hashing functions

- I use static analysis tools, such as Mythril, Slither, and Oyente, to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses. These tools can catch common issues like reentrancy, integer overflows/underflows, and race conditions. However, they should be used as a complement to manual review, as they may produce false positives or false negatives.
-I analyze the code for potential gas inefficiencies and recommend improvements where possible. This both reduces the overall cost of using the contract and mitigates the risk of denial-of-service attacks due to high gas costs.
- I ensure that the code follows established best practices for smart contract development, such as using the latest Solidity version, employing the 'checks-effects-interactions' pattern, and adhering to the Solidity Style Guide.
- I verify that the code is well-documented, with clear descriptions of functions, variables, and contract interactions. Proper documentation is crucial for understanding the contract's behavior and ensuring that developers can maintain and extend the code in the future.
- I review the tests to ensure adequate coverage of the contracts and their functions. I may also create additional tests to cover edge cases or potential vulnerabilities.

 I perform the above review process for each one, tailoring my approach to the specific functionality and purpose of each contract. Focus areas would include:

i . Security-sensitive functions and logic in WiseLending, WiseSecurity, and WiseCore
ii . Interactions between contracts and WiseSecurity, WiseLending, WiseOracleHub, FeeManager, and PowerFarmController
iii . Derivative oracle implementations in PtOraclePure, PtOracleDerivative, and PendleLpOracle
iv . Complex financial logic and gas efficiency in PowerFarmNFTs, PowerFarmMathLogic, and PendlePowerManager
v . Access control, role management, and secure communication between contracts in OwnableMaster, WiseLowLevelHelper, and WrapperHub
vi . Proper handling of transfer helper functions in TransferHelper, SendValueHelper, and ApprovalHelper
vii . Event tracking and emissions in FeeManagerEvents, AaveHelper, and Aave Hub contracts

By systematically reviewing each contract and its interactions with other contracts in the codebase, I can effectively identify potential vulnerabilities and recommend improvements to strengthen the security and efficiency of the Wise Lending Codebase.

## 11 . Risk Model Analysis üìä


### 11.1 Centralization Risks

- All contracts are owned by the OwnableMaster contract, which can potentially become a central point of control.
- The WiseCore contract has a wxToken variable that can be modified by the contract owner, introducing a potential single point of failure.
- The WiseSecurity contract allows the owner to add or remove strategies, which can lead to centralization if the owner has too much control over the system.
- The PoolManager contract is responsible for managing pools and can potentially become a central point of control.
- The PendlePowerFarmController contract allows the owner to add or remove vaults, which can lead to centralization if the owner has too much control over the system.

### 11.2 Systematic Risks

- The contracts rely on external sources such as Aave and Pendle, making them susceptible to potential issues in those systems.
- The contracts use price feeds from oracles, which can introduce systematic risk if the oracles provide incorrect or manipulated data.
- The WiseSecurity contract uses a fraction variable to determine the allocation of funds, which can introduce systematic risk if the value is not properly managed.
- Liquidity risks might arise from impermanent loss in Aave and Pendle pools.

### 11.3 Technical Risks

- There is no formal verification of the smart contracts, increasing the risk of undiscovered bugs and vulnerabilities.
- The use of low-level functions such as .delegatecall() and .create2() can introduce technical risks and complexities.
- The use of unchecked arithmetic operations can introduce technical risks, as overflows or underflows might not be properly handled.
- The PendlePowerFarmMathLogic contract uses SafeMath library for arithmetic operations, but there are still some instances where arithmetic operations can cause issues if not handled correctly.

### 11.4 Integration Risks

- The contracts rely on integration with other protocols like Aave and Pendle, making them susceptible to potential compatibility issues and bugs.
- The PendlePowerFarmToken contract uses IERC20Upgradeable and IUniswapV2Pair interfaces, which can introduce integration risks if the interfaces are not properly implemented or maintained.

### 11.5 Weak Spots & Single Point of Failure

- The WiseLowLevelHelper contract provides low-level functionality, which can potentially become a single point of failure if not properly secured and tested.
- The PendlePowerFarmTokenFactory contract is responsible for creating new power farm tokens, which can potentially become a single point of failure if not properly secured and tested.
- The FeeManager contract handles fees and distributes them to various recipients; any issues with this contract can disrupt the fee distribution mechanism, becoming a single point of failure.
- The OracleHelper contract retrieves and processes price feeds, which can potentially become a single point of failure if not properly secured and tested.
- The MainHelper contract provides various helper functions, including createPool(), which can potentially become a single point of failure if not properly secured and tested.

## 12 . Area of Improvemets üéØ

- Use of calldata instead of memory for function parameters that are not modified. This can save gas by avoiding copying data.
- Avoid internal function calls in loops and move the logic outside the loop whenever possible.
- Consider using unchecked arithmetic operations for internal calculations to save gas.
- Use immutable for constants and values that do not change after contract deployment.
- Use constant instead of public for getter functions that do not modify the contract state.
- Consider using solc compiler optimizations to reduce gas costs.
- Use require statements instead of assert for internal checks and revert for external checks to save gas.
- Avoid using send and transfer functions for transferring ether. Use .call.value() instead.
- Avoid using now in contracts. Instead, use a more specific timestamp variable.
- Make sure that all event logs have the correct indexed fields.
- Implement time-locking mechanisms to prevent front-running.
- Use withdraw patterns instead of pull patterns to save gas.
- Consider using OpenZeppelin libraries for security-critical code.
- Use random number generators that are secure and verifiable to prevent manipulation.
- Ensure that all contracts have proper initialization and termination mechanisms.
- Consider using upgradeable contracts to allow for future changes.

## 13 . What ideas can be incorporated?

Incorporating the following ideas in the Wise Lending protocol can potentially add value and improve its overall functionality:

- Introduce limit orders and stop orders to let users automate their trades based on predefined price levels. These orders can help users mitigate risks by controlling the maximum and minimum prices of their trades.
- Implement algorithms that adjust interest rates dynamically based on the utilization of lending pools. High utilization rates can trigger higher interest rates, while the opposite holds for underutilized pools. This will help optimize capital efficiency and maintain liquidity.
-  Allow users to manage their debt and collateralization levels easily via in-built tools. By monitoring their collateralization ratio, users can set up alerts or automatic actions when it falls below a given threshold, minimizing the risk of liquidation.
- Incorporate flash loans within the lending protocol for developers to build new DeFi solutions without the need for external funding. Flash loans require the borrowed amount to be repaid within the same transaction to avoid liquidation. This feature can potentially open up many use cases and innovative solutions within the DeFi space.
- Develop partnerships and integrations with leading blockchain networks to enable cross-chain interoperability, thereby connecting more users and expanding the liquidity available in the protocol.
- Explore opportunities for integration with popular decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, and other DeFi projects. Such integrations can expand the user base, allow for more comprehensive service offerings, and create additional revenue streams.
- Develop support for fractionalized NFTs, which allow users to split the ownership of a single NFT into multiple parts. This feature can enable users to trade and earn yields in multiple ways, thus opening up opportunities for NFT-based lending, collateralization, and yield farming.
- Introduce a native governance token, enabling token holders to propose, vote, and implement changes to the protocol. This can not only establish a decentralized governing body but also encourage community participation and adoption.
- Create loyalty programs to incentivize long-term engagement and reward loyal users with reduced fees, better interest rates, or other perks. This can translate to long-term user retention and market growth.
- Implement interest rate swaps between lending pools with different risk profiles or assets, allowing users to swap fixed and variable interest rates, thereby hedging risks and catering to varying preferences.

## 14 . Tips & Thoughts üí°

Check the contract's variable and function modifiers, especially onlyOwner, onlyPoolManager, and onlyWhitelisted. Ensure that these modifiers are used appropriately and that access control is properly implemented.

Examine the constructor functions for initialization checks. Look for checks to ensure that the contract owner is set correctly and that any needed configuration settings are properly initialized.

Review the contract's state variables. Consider whether mutable state variables need to be mutable, and whether immutable state variables could have been used instead. Look for variables that are used only for internal calculations and consider optimizing by making them private.

Examine the contract's functions for input validation, particularly for functions that allow users to transfer or withdraw funds. Ensure that sufficient checks are in place to prevent unauthorized access to contract funds.

Check for the correct use of revert(), require(), and assert(). These functions should be used to ensure that preconditions and invariants are satisfied.

Look for functions that allow users to transfer funds between contracts. Examine these functions closely to ensure that the correct amounts are being transferred and that there are no vulnerabilities that would allow for the theft of funds.

In the WiseSecurity contract, review the implementation of ensureCanTransfer and ensure that it is functioning as intended. Consider whether there are edge cases that might require additional checks.

In the WiseLowLevelHelper contract, review the implementation of the getReservePrice function. Ensure that the function is working as intended and that it is calculating the correct reserve price.

In the FeeManager contract, review the implementation of the _reduceFee function. Ensure that the function is updating fees correctly and that there are no rounding errors.

In the WiseOracleHub contract, review the implementation of the setToken function. Check that the function is updating the token mapping correctly and that there are no vulnerabilities that would allow for the manipulation of oracle data.

In the PendlePowerFarmController contract, review the implementation of the _updateFees function. Ensure that the function is updating fees correctly and that there are no rounding errors.

In the PowerFarmNFTs contract, review the implementation of the mint function. Check that the function is minting the correct number of NFTs and that there are no vulnerabilities that would allow for the creation of excess NFTs.

In the DerivativeOracles contracts, review the implementation of the oracle functions. Check that the functions are correctly querying external data sources and that there are no vulnerabilities that would allow for manipulation of oracle data.

In the TransferHub contracts, review the implementation of the transfer function. Ensure that the function is correctly transferring funds between contracts and that it is properly handling any potential exceptions.

Perform a thorough check for the correct handling of exceptions. Look for functions that call external contracts and ensure that exceptions are properly handled and that the contract is not left in an unpredictable state.

Consider the gas costs of each contract's functions. Identify any functions that are particularly gas-intensive and look for ways to optimize them.

Consider the re-usability of the contract code. Identify any code that could be abstracted into shared libraries and consider creating reusable library contracts to improve code maintenance and reduce gas costs.






## 15 .  Architectural Recommendations üèõÔ∏è 

- The codebase is quite large and contains many contracts. It would be beneficial to organize the contracts into subdirectories based on their functionality, such as oracle, fee_manager, power_farm, security, and transfer_hub.
- Consider creating interfaces for each contract, which would clearly specify their intended functionalities and help reduce the coupling between contracts.
- Use consistent naming conventions for functions and variables across all contracts. For instance, use get prefix for read-only functions and set prefix for write functions.
- Make sure to break down larger contracts into smaller, modular contracts that can be easily tested and understood.
- Use inheritance to share logic between similar contracts, but avoid deep inheritance trees, as this may result in hard-to-trace bugs.

**Gas optimization**
- Replace send() and transfer() with require() statements, when possible, to avoid failure/exception handling.
- Consider using calldata instead of memory for read-only arrays and structs passed to functions for gas savings.
- Avoid using delete on large arrays, as it is expensive. Instead, consider resetting a struct or a smaller array in case of a reset.

**Security**

- Implement a timelock for critical functions to prevent flash loan attacks.
- Perform formal verification using tools like Mythril and Securify to identify potential security issues.
- Use the Checks Effects Interactions pattern to reduce the likelihood of transaction-ordering dependency bugs.
